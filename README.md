# NLL
Negative Log Likelihood minimiser coded for the Computational Physics course Project B.  

Five optimisation algorithms were coded for multi-dimensional numerical minimisation:
- Gradient
- Newton
- Quasi-newton
- Simulated Annealing
- Nelder-Mead

Validation done with the scipy.optimize.fmin function which uses the Nelder-Mead algorithm.
